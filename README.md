# GitHub Issuetracker

This issuetracker is supposed to automatically fetch issue data from the [SORMAS](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/SORMAS-Project) repository.
Issues can also be fetched from other repositories with the necessary configuration.

Issue Progress ratings are based on whether the issue is closed and/or assigned to a project board. The version next to finished issues is basd on the issues milestone.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS!**

## Usage

After setting up configuration, Issues will be fetched from the configured GitHub Project.
If an Issue or Issue Comment contains text starting with the `DescriptionIdentifier`, it will be automatically used to build a description for the issuetracker.
Example:

```
<!--
### Issuetracker-Description-DE[Translated Title]
Translated Content
### End-Description-DE
-->
```

## Configuration

To configure the issuetracker, change the values of the JavaScript Objects `Config`, `ProgressState` and `i18n` in `DataFetcher.js`

#### General Config

* `Projects[]`: These Projects-IDs will be used to determine issue progress.
* `AllowedCommentAuthorIDs[]`: GitHub-user-ids who are allowed to change the feature description via comments.
* `AllowedCommentAuthorAssociations[]`: Array of GitHub Author Associations. Similar to AllowedCommentAuthorIDs, but seemingly **unreliable**. 
* `Label`: Issue label. Only Issues with this label will be considered by the issuetracker
* `DescriptionIdentifier`: Identifier which will be used to mark the beginning of a custom Issue Description
* `DescriptionEndTag`: Optional end-tag of custom descriptions.
* `displayDaysIfFinished`: How long finished features are to be displayed (days)
* `maxIssuesToFetch`: Maximum amount of issues to fetch. Reduce to save data. Increase for completeness. Maximum value 100
* `maxEventsToFetch`: Same as above. Recommended: 60
* `maxCommentsToFetch`: Same as above.

Please note that Events and Comments are fetched oldest-newest, so if there are more comments than maxCommentsToFetch, the newest comments **will not be fetched**.

#### i18n and ProjectStates
Placeholders to allow basic translation of the page.
Usage: `'<text>' : '<translation>'`

* `planned`: Issues which are not assigned to a relevant project board nor closed
* `development`: Issues which are open and assigned to a relevant project
* `done`: Issues which are closed
* `GitHubIssue`: GitHub Issue
* `NoDescriptionFound`: Text when no description was found
* `Description`: Description
* `Links`: Links
